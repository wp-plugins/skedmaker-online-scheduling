Skedmaker is an online appointment booking system that lets your clients make a reservation with you via the internet, 24/7/365. 

== Description ==

Skedmaker's Plugin for Wordpress is an online schedule and appointment system that lets your clients make an appointment with you via the internet 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.
Create your own schedule, and get e-mail notices when clients make an appointment with you.
You don't have to know a drop of code to use skedmaker. Activate the Skedmaker Wordpress Plugin and start customizing your schedule in minutes.
Select the duration of your appointments on any day, from 15 minute sessions to full-day appointments.
Allow for multiple appointments at the same time.
Block specific timeframes or disable entire days from being available.
You can also select a range of dates to block out, which helps you to disable your schedule for holidays etc.
Give your clients the ability to shchedule themselves at their own convenience — at any time of the day.
Have a complex schedule? Skedmaker allows you to create "Custom Days" with varying timeframes and number of availabile appointments.
Enter detailed information about your business including map directions, phone numbers, website physical address and more -- which is all emailed to your client when they schedule an appointment with you.
You control every part of your schedule with our easy-to-use administrator pages which you can access through your Wordpress Admin page.
List all your future or past appointments on one page with actions to manage your clients appointments. 
Send no-show notices by e-mail asking your clients to reschedule if they fail to arrive for their appointments.
If your schedule is sensitive and (for example) only for your employees or yourself, you may select to use a password to protect it.
Edit the color scheme of Skedmaker to fit your Wordpress theme by selecting from a list of predefined patterns. 
You can also enter specific color codes to create a more customized scheme for your schedule.
